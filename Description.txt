Problem Statement: To check if any non-rotated rectangles overlap each other in a 2-D space in a set of rectangles provided as user input.

Solution Description:
-The program I have written takes an input from user asking them for the number of rectangles to check for overlap.

-It then asks the user to input co-ordinates for each rectangle in the set of rectangles(which should be given in clock-wise order).

-It checks for overlap through each unique pair of rectangles  in the set of rectangles.

-Publishes results showing which pairs of rectangles overlap each other.If none of them overlap,it prints a message saying that none of them overlap.

Input format
User has to enter co-ordinates of the rectangle in the format shown below:-
Example: 1,2

 
Known issues-
-Unit testing and Exception handling remain undone because of a few time constraints.

-I couldn't add functionality for intersection in three-dimensions and other shapes as it was affecting my implementation of the interface I had defined.But it still can be added using the interface.

-I couldn't work on the Possible extensions as I was mainly trying to focus on the core logic implementation and didn't have time on my hands for the same reason.
